# Terminal Coursework

In this coursework we want to test what you've learnt in the previous coursework.

## Tasks

### 1) Find my script

In this repository you'll find `MyDocuments` - this is all the documents that I use on my laptop.

I need to find the `script.js` file that is a part of MyFirstWebsite however you are **not** allowed to use a GUI, you must use Command Line and the Terminal.

What commands would I need to use to find this file? In the section below, write all the commands you used.

Hint: You should use `cd` and `ls`.

### 3) Counting Script

Next, I want you to run the script in this directory

```
/MyDocuments/Scripts/
```

./count_to_100.sh
```

when you're in the correct directory.

For this task, I want you to **stop** the counter when I have counted to 10.
